**ASSIGNMENT ON GIT AND GITHUB @LEARNABLE**
This repository is created for the purpose of the assignment on version control.

## Write-ups


1. **Version Control:**
   Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows multiple contributors to collaborate efficiently.

2. **Git vs GitHub:**
   Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

3. **GitHub Alternatives:**
   Here are three alternative platforms to GitHub:
   - GitLab
   - Bitbucket
   - SourceForge

4. **Git Fetch vs Git Pull:**
   - `git fetch`: Fetches changes from a remote repository but does not merge them.
   - `git pull`: Fetches changes and automatically merges them into the current branch.

5. **Git Rebase:**
   Git rebase is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another. It rewrites the commit history.
        command>>
   git rebase branch_name

6. **Git Cherry-Pick:**
    Git cherry-pick is a command to apply a specific commit from one branch to another.
        command>>
    git cherry-pick commit_hash


In conclusion, understanding version control concepts and Git commands is essential for efficient collaboration in software development projects..
